# HW0

This homework will prepare you for basic setup for the course.

## Basic course setup (10)

Properly setting up your Mattermost and Moodle profile by providing a picture will help the teaching staff learn your name. Upload a current headshot picture of you (not anyone else, not a cartoon picture of you, etc.) to your Moodle profile. For Slack, make sure you have your first and last name as part of your profile. Use [US passport photo guidelines](http://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/photocomptemplate/photocomptemplate_5297.html).

## Github (10)

Sign into [NCSU's GitHub](https://github.ncsu.edu/).

1. Create a *private* repo called HW0-DevOps. 
2. Go to Settings, Collaborators and Teams, and add the TAs and instructor as a collaborator (using their unity id).

## Screencasts Guidelines

Here are some guidelines and links for creating good screencasts. It is good to get ready now to learn how to create demo videos for your future project milestones and career.

A general guideline: Do whatever it would do if you were teaching someone how to do something. For example, you don’t have to show people you typing and creating the whole commit, but you might want to show the contents of the hook in a text editor, before doing a commit.
 
##### Software

* camtasia
* https://github.com/justinfrankel/licecap (for simple .gif that you can stitch together in video...)
* screencastomatic
* Add more recommendations in Mattermost/NC Stack Overflow Questions
 
##### Guidelines for both multimedia formats:

* Keep the content simple - A regular software engineer without knowing anything about your tool should be able to follow you

##### Guidelines for screencasts (video)

* Mention your name, unity ID and the tool/source code which you will be testing/demoing when you begin
* Use a headset microphone for good quality audio recording.
* Create a script and rehearse that script

##### Guidelines for making a screencast:

* Consider investing in a nicer [video and mic setup](http://pgbovine.net/video-recording-setup.htm).
* https://wiki.duraspace.org/plugins/viewsource/viewpagesrc.action?pageId=30218666 (also good suggestions for podcasts)
* From http://www.screencast.com/help/tutorial.aspx?id=403
* Practice on screen movements as they can appear jerky when viewing but not as a user.
* Script out complex parts.
* Speak clearly and enunciate, also, have good sound quality.
* Background noise can be distracting.
* From http://diythemes.com/thesis/how-to-create-screencasts/
* Know what you want to present and present it accordingly.
* Organize your thoughts.
* Rehearse such that your casts does not faulter midway.
* Take time to edit your screencast so it does not feel rough around the edges.
