# Milestone: DEPLOYMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE, and something SPECIAL

Previously, we've focused on building, testing, and analysis of our software in a continuous deployment pipeline. Now, we're ready to start deploying software into production environments and designing and managing production infrastructure.

### Deployment Components

Your production infrastructure and deployment pipeline should support the following properties.

* **Deployment:** Deploy iTrust and checkbox.io to a production environment. Create a git hook on your jenkins server that will trigger a deployment when doing a git push to "production". The deployment needs to occur on actual remote machine (e.g. AWS, droplet, VCL), and not a local VM. The deployment should provision and configure the production environment using scripts+ansible.

* **Feature Flags:** Create a configuration server for managing feature flags (using redis) that can be used to turn off/on features on iTrust in production. Pick one feature to demo in screencast.

### Infrastructure Components

* **Infrastructure Upgrade** Make improvements to the infrastructure of checkbox.io.

  - Extract a new microservice for rendering markdown => html in checkbox.io. Deploy several instances of microservice (at least 3). Demonstrate service availabilty after turning off nodes. You may use a cluster such as nomad, kubernetes, or implement your own strategy.

    In other words, replace the call to `marqdown.render` to use your cluster of microservices.
    ```
    app.post('/api/design/survey', 
        function(req,res)
        {
            console.log(req.body.markdown);
            var text = marqdown.render( req.body.markdown );
            res.send( {preview: text} );
        }
    );
    ```

### Special Component

Add a new idea to your pipeline. Choose one of the following:

- a chaos experiment/monkey
- monitoring/analysis
- deployment strategy (canary releases, etc.)
- introduce new infrastructure upgrades
- something cool.

### Final Demo

In addition to your normal screencast to demonstrate your functionality, you will prepare a whole project demo.

Prepare a 4 minute screencast demonstrating your entire project, detailing the overall architecture of pipeline, as well as details of the components. You will want to make this a professionally edited video -- something that you can show to others when you go on the job market.

*BONUS:* The best 3 project presentations will get +10% bonus.

### Evalution

This milestone will be worth 20% of the final grade.

* Production deployment: 20%
* Feature flags: 20%
* Infrastructure Upgrades (microservices+cluster): 20%
* Something special: 20%
* Screencast for functionality: 10%
* Final Demo Video: 10%


### Submission

[Submit here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1rztOb5IWu1kFtp5OSgQ2sQTja8zluuzNfgnzQuL2GTdImg/viewform?usp=sf_link), a link to your repo that includes

your code, a README.md and screencast, describing how your milestone meets each requirement.

Due Sunday, April 28th before midnight.
