# Milestone: SPECIAL

### Last component

You must add a new component to your pipeline.

##### Some ideas.

* Introduce a waterfall staging component.
* Introduce resilience testing (chaos monkey).
* Implement a new deployment strategy.
* Implement a more advanced fuzzing/test generation technique.
* Create a novel IaaS/PaaS/app (e.g., [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/), a service to make it easy to do UI testing of a deployed app on many browser versions).

You will likely be less suprised by your final score by vetting your idea before submission.

### Presentation

Prepare a 5 minute screencast demostrating your entire project, with at least half allocated to describing your special component.

This video will be shown in class and you will be explaining the video as it plays in class.  Your video shown in class can be considered a "draft", you will have a chance to update it before your final submission.

Please provide a link to your video [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BdqdwARU_VVfLXXCQSp6gMiggDYUfsrVgxUQeOJMu68/edit#gid=0) for presentation in the class.
