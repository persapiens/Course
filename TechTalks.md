# Tech Talks

For students in CSC591, you will be required to present a short talk and demo (10 minutes) about a DevOps related tool. Students will also need to be able to answer questions about the tool (5 minutes of discussion).

You will also turn in a repo containing a report and resources related to the tool.

**You will get in groups of 4**

You do not have to be in same groups as your project. There is no relation.

The following criteria will be used in evaluating your talk (each worth 5 points):

* summarize the main purpose of the tool?
* relate the tool to previously presented articles?
* present the tool in a clear, logical manner?
* critique the tool and present possible limitations?
* justify his or her own opinions about the tool?
* personalize the topic, such as by bringing in their own experiences?
* demonstrates how to use the tool with simple example?
* conveys value of tool in demonstration? 
* facilitate a lively discussion of the tool?
* acts as an expert about the tool, answering clarifying questions as they arise?

A repo and report describing tool will be also be graded on the following criteria:

* Provides a high level report about tool (10 points)
* Provides setup instructions (sample code, configuration files, install scripts) 20 points
* Provides a screencast or demo environment (e.g. virtual machine) using tool on a sample task (20 points).
